  :rocket: Used Technologies
</h2>

- [Next.js with TypeScript](https://nextjs.org/)- Next.js is a framework built on top of React. It was used to build the app in general. 
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - Styled components is a CSS-in-JS library. It was used to style the whole app.
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) - React Testing Library is a library that allows us to create unit and integration tests of React components. It was used to test the components.
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - Cypress is a library that allows us to create end to end tests on webpages. It was used to make the end to end tests on the website, this way we can make sure that the site will work correctly in production

<h2 id="objective" name="objective">
  :dart: Project's goal
</h2>

The aim of this project was practicing Next.js with TypeScript, I have been studying these technologies really much lately because I like them. I also took the opportunity to test all the pieces of the app, from the components to the whole pages.

- All the pages were statically generated, which improves the user experience since the page will not take long to load and be available to use.
- User can play podcasts from the home page and from the page of the own episode as well.
